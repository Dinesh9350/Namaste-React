1. What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.
Sol 1) Import Images:
Import the image as a module and use it in your JSX.

import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; 

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
    </div>
  );
}

Public Folder:
Place images in the public folder and reference them using relative URLs.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
    </div>
  );
}
Inline Data URLs:
Embed images directly using Data URLs.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..." alt="Logo" />
    </div>
  );
}

2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
Sol 2) console.log(useState()):
Calling console.log(useState()) will log an array that contains the current state value and the state updater function. For example:
console.log(useState());
Output:-
[initialStateValue, stateUpdaterFunction]


3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
Sol 3) useEffect without Dependency Array:
If you omit the dependency array in useEffect, the effect will run after every render of the component, including the initial render. This can lead to unintended side effects, such as excessive re-renders or unnecessary network requests.

4. What is SPA?
Sol 4) Single Page Application (SPA):
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates content on a single HTML page without requiring full page reloads. It uses client-side rendering to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

5. What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
Sol 5) Client-Side Routing vs. Server-Side Routing:

Client-Side Routing: In client-side routing, the routing logic is handled by JavaScript running in the browser. When a user navigates to a different route, the client-side router updates the view without a full page reload. This provides a faster and smoother user experience. Libraries like react-router enable client-side routing in React apps.

Server-Side Routing: In server-side routing, the server handles the routing logic. Each time a user navigates to a different route, the server responds with a new HTML page. This approach requires full page reloads, which can be slower compared to client-side routing.

Client-side routing offers better performance and interactivity, while server-side routing might have a simpler implementation but could result in slower user experiences due to the repeated loading of entire pages.
