What is JSX?
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manipulate UI elements. JSX gets transpiled into regular JavaScript code before being rendered by the browser.

Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
type attribute in the script tag is used to specify the MIME type of the script. The most common value is "text/javascript", which indicates that the content of the script tag contains JavaScript code. Other possible values include "module", which is used for JavaScript modules

{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
{TitleComponent}: This syntax will insert the content of the TitleComponent without rendering it as a component. It's useful when you want to insert the component's content into the JSX structure.

{<TitleComponent/>}: This syntax will render the TitleComponent component as a self-closing tag.
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}: This syntax will render the TitleComponent component using an opening and closing tag, allowing you to place other JSX elements within it.
